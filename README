This package contains a set of browser backends to support Mono.WebBrowser. They are privately GAC'd assemblies
used by Mono.WebBrowser directly, and are not meant to be linked to directly (hence no .pc files)

To build from git:

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

This also build a simple test app in tests/simple/ . You can run it with mono after first setting the environment
variable:

MONO_BROWSER_ENGINE=webkit

and copy "mono-webkit.dll" from mono-webkit/ into tests/simple/ . It is a not well-documented quirk that Mono's
implementation of System.Windows.Forms.Browsers looks for a suitably written "mono-webkit.dll" in the assembly
load path if MONO_BROWSER_ENGINE=webkit is set. Read the source.
